# E-Wall-Magazine-display-RCCIIT
In our department at RCC Institute of Computer Applications, Kolkata, we have lots of submissions for Wall magazine. Therefore, I have decided to design a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where all the photo submissions can be displayed. It also has an about section, where I put the developer. And it will take you to our college's main website.
In addition, there is a future scope, and we are working on that in many sections. This is so that every year new students can update their photos in the wall magazine.
